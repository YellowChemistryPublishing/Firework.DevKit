# Firework.Runtime

A a blazing fast<sup>\[citation needed\]</sup>, lightweight game and application development library that is intuitive and easy to use, whilst also being performant and efficient.  
This library is _very_ in-development right now, and definitely should not be used beyond experimentation. (Some commits might not even build!)


## Known Issues

-   Software rendering under Linux with llvmpipe for the Vulkan backend will crash if you resize the window, or worse, on startup! (If it doesn't, you'll almost certainly leak memory...)  
    -   We believe it is a driver issue, caused by the API not waiting when we want it to. This will not occur with hardware supported drivers.
