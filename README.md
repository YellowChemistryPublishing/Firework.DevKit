# Firework.DevKit

A a blazing fast [citation needed], lightweight game and application development library that is intuitive and easy to use, whilst also being performant and efficient.  
This dev kit is _very_ in-development right now, and definitely should not be used beyond experimentation. (Some commits might not even build!)
